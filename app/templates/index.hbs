<p>I call it "Theory of Problem Solving": a blog of tutorials and in-depth analyses of the problems that I solve. I would like to share this with everyone in the Codeforces community!

It's just getting started, and many of my analyses are really long, because I wanted to focus on the process more than the solution. Anyway, take a look at the analysis of Codeforces Round #224 (Div. 2) E â€” Ksenia and Combinatorics!
Feel free to make comments or requests for specific problems!
Thanks everyone! Happy Coding! I will be posting more soon. Cheers!
